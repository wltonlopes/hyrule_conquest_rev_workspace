ReDead
Feared for it's terrifying scream that freezes enemies in place, the ReDead is fearsome opponent for any melee soldier.
It is said that ReDeads are the servants and retainers of cruel Hylian nobles, who were killed and buried with their master in his tomb.
A ReDead looks like an emaciated body, wearing a wooden mask. When it sees an opponent, it freezes it's prey in place with it's chilling scream, then latches on and sucks the victim's blood.
Even more feared, the ReDead Knight is the noble. With a more powerful scream, and weilding a massive sword, these opponents still regain some intelligence, allowing them to lead other ReDeads into battle.
