Stalfos
Very, very cheap, but also much weaker and slower than other races
Cost mostly food and metal, with the occaisonal stone or wood.
Almost only infantry units, with some creatures and a tiny bit of cavalry.
All Stal units can walk under water, while all Poe units can fly over any terrain.
Perform best with horde tactics: training hundreds of troops to overwhelm the enemy with numbers.
