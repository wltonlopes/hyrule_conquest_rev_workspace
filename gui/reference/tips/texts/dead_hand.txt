Dead Hand
Of all of Hyrule's undead, one stands out as the most horrifying and monsterous: the Dead Hand.
While their origins are unknown, these multi-limbed horrors are feared, even by other undead.
A Dead Hand takes the form of a large blood-splattered corpse without arms. When hunting, it burrows into the ground, leaving several semi-autonomous arms poking out of the ground to grab it's prey.
