    <History>To many in Ordona Province, Rusl is just an average trader who makes rounds to Hyrule Proper and Lanayru. Those that know him personally are more than likely aware of his small background in military. Unlike many Ordonians, Rusl was actually professionally trained in several Hylian military academies, with rumors that he was attempting to become the first Hyrulean Knight from Ordona Province. Somewhere along the lines he left his studies and became the salesman he was later known as. Rusl is known for his kindness and perhaps most importantly, calmness. Even in sticky situations he maintains a level head and never shows any signs of panic.</History>
