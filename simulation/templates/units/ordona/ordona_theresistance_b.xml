    <History>A unique unit only available to Ashei. Functions like a single extra Hero unit, composed of Auru, Telma, and Shad. Once a Hyrulean Knight who served in the Gerudo Wars, Auru was a personal friend of Ashei's father and the first man to join his Resistance organization. Upon joining he quickly became the group's weapon supplier, using his many connections both within and outside of Hyrule to bring both armor and weapons to the group. After the death of Ashei's father he unofficially became leader of the Resistance until Ashei herself assumed the mantle. He has famously acquired a hand cannon from Labrynna, and hopes to funnel more of their advanced weaponry in the future. Famous for her bar in Hyrule Castle Town, Telma is a Hylian who comes from Gerudo parentage and was raised on the eastern edge of the desert. She has numerous connections through her bar association, both legal and shady, and provides various contracts and resources to the fuel the Resistance. She's not much of a fighter, but can defend herself with a quarterstaff. Shad hails from the eastern land of Labrynna and is an skilled scholar and archaeologist. He ventures to explore Hyrule's many ruins, with a particular fascination for the Oocca. After becoming a member of the Resistance, he provided countless maps of secret passageways and long lost routes that he charted on his many ventures into the wilderness and currently maintains its many supply routes.</History>
