    <History>The daughter of a Hylian Knight, Ashei's father was expelled from his order for having a child with an Ordonian wife and corrupting the bloodline of it's members. With little place for him as a farmer in Ordon, Ashei's father instead wandered east into the mountains of Labrynna where he later established the Resistance: a paramilitary order of knights and mercenaries that seek out and stop threats to Hyrule before wars break out. He raised Ashei to become a knight as he was, in hopes that she will inherit the Resistance. Without the rigid order and imperious military looming over her training, Ashei has turned out much different than most professional soldiers. With no true connection to any nation, she is more mercenary than knight, adapting and learning a wide variety of combat techniques and sword fighting arts from various cultures.</History>
