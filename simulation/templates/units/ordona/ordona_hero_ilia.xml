    <History>Ilia is the daughter of Mayor Bo and was the trading assistant of Rusl in her youth. Being born into a privileged class, she had the opportunity to try various job paths before settling on breeding and training horses. As a young adult Ilia has become quite a business woman in Ordona Province, gaining stock over some of the best horses in Hyrule while simultaneously leading the Rangers and managing a lumber company to supply the building of stables across Hyrule. She is known for her party loving personality and habit of holding down quite a bit of ale. She has somewhat of a friendly rivalry with Malon of Lon Lon Ranch, and hopes to one day out-compete the famous horse breeder. In battle Ilia rides atop a horse, using a Ranger Crossbow to snipe down anyone who threatens the Province.</History>
