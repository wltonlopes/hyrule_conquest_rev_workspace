    <History>The creation of horrifying magic that was outlawed and sealed away in Hyrule’s ancient past, the Stalfos are a vast ever growing army of animated corpses. Headed by a collection of warring and elite Necromancers, the modern incarnation of Hyrule’s undead seek to fill its ranks with mindless followers and to establish a kingdom of immortality that can stand against the other forces of Hyrule.</History>
