    <History>A vast majority of the gentle plains across Ordona Province are covered in rich and fertile farmland. The lowest members of Ordonian society labor over these lands to feed their families and pay tribute to their local Fief Lords. Pumpkins are perhaps Ordona's most famous crop, though many things are grown in their homeland.</History>
