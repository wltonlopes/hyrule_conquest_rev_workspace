    <History>These wicked plants grew like ravenous weeds throughout Hyrule's various forests, but were quite friendly to Deku Scrubs. Many Scrubs took them in as pets, and still yet they were used by their armies for guard duty. Deku Babas were completely immobile and on their own could do little more than protect their immediate area. They could be mounted on the heads of many Deku Scrubs and the backs of their Orhat Beetles however, giving whatever unit they were attached to a bonus melee attack.</History>
    <Tooltip>Small immobile Creature unit that can be picked up by a wide variety of units to augment their abilities.</Tooltip>
