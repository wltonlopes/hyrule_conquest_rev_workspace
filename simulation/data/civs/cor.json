					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The brother to King Kud-Loh-Kan, Ach-Thok-Gran is cold-hearted and violent, even for a Corrupted. He wishes nothing more than to spread the Corruption into his brother's kingdom, so that he will be strong enough to conquer the rest of Hyrule. The evil power that the Corrupted suffer under has affected him to the core, turning this once-carefree Scrub into one of the most heartless creatures in all of Hyrule. He cares nothing for the subjects he enslaves, seeing them as stepping-stones to that exist only to further his own power."

					"Name": "War Leader Wech-Grok-Thurg",

					"Armament": "Clawed Hands",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "War leader of the Corrupted hordes, Wech-Grok-Thurg gained his position in the only way the Corrupted know how: by killing the former War Leader in single combat. Though undeniably the ugliest and strongest of the Corrupted, he is still intelligant enough to plan battles, even if they ususally amount to 'You hit them here, I'll hit them there'."

					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "A personal servant of King Kuh-Loh-Kan and manager of all things money, Butler Kuh-Do is quiet and out of the spotlight, but clearly has vast power over Scrub kind. His hands seem to be tied to the Scrubs' growing markets across Hyrule, and he maintains his own force of tax collectors and bullies to insure that the royal coffers... and his personal bank account... are flowing with Rupees."

					"Name": "Titan: Odwala, Armored Colossus",
					"Class": "Titan",
					"Armament": "Horns",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "This giant hulking Orhat Beetle has long lurked on the eastern forests of Hyrule. In some cases the Scrubs have been known to coerce this huge monster into fighting on their behalf. Stagnox may be slow, but his armor is some of the most impressive and durable in Hyrule. While the Stagnox has wings, his huge size makes his ability to fly very limited."
