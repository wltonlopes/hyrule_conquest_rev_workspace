It is incompatible with all other races.\n\nThe AI's resource gathering rate and trade gain depend on the difficulty level (Sandbox −58%, Very Easy −44%, Easy −25%, Medium ±0%, Hard +25%, Very Hard +56%). The easiest levels also have a slower research, training, and building rate. In addition, the Sandbox level does not expand nor attack.",
