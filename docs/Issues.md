==================
All errors for specific civilizations are listed here, under the civlilization that they belong to.

#Deku
========
* Because Deku Babas can't move, when you turret them on a Deku Scrub, they break any formations. 
  Individual movement still works, but formations won't move.
  
#Kokiri
========
* There is some strange error when the Kokiri Structure Tree is opened.
  
#Ordona
========
* Some of the rubble actors are missing textures.

#Lanayru
